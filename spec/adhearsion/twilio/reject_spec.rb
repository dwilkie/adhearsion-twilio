    # The <Reject> verb rejects an incoming call to your Twilio number without billing you.
    # This is very useful for blocking unwanted calls.

    # If the first verb in a TwiML document is <Reject>,
    # Twilio will not pick up the call.
    # The call ends with a status of 'busy' or 'no-answer',
    # depending on the verb's 'reason' attribute.
    # Any verbs after <Reject> are unreachable and ignored.

    # Note that using <Reject> as the first verb in your response is the only way
    # to prevent Twilio from answering a call.
    # Any other response will result in an answered call and your account will be billed.
